# regressionToolExample1

# this is a tool i designed with python to automate manual testing at a company i work/worked at. by pointing a list of commmands to test, it will work its way through each command 1 by 1 and mimic the use of a voice remote control via cURL. the benefit of this is it allows each command to be tested without actually speaking into the remote control and controlling the remote control and the commandss programmatically
